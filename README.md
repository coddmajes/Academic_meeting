# Abstract
We propose a strategy of sparse dictionary learning together with automatic tuning of the step size in the iterative soft thresholding algorithm (ISTA) via its unfolding to a computation graph. Our strategy makes ISTA trainable by back-propagation so as not only to fit the sparse dictionary to a training dataset but also to improve the speed of convergence. Our novelty is in the use of back-propable eigen decomposition in the unfolded ISTA to enable the step size tuning. Our work simplifies the sparse solver and outperforms the state-of-the-art unfolding techniques.
